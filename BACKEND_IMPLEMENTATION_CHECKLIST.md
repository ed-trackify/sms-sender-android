  - message (TEXT)
  - reply_type (VARCHAR(50))
  - received_timestamp (BIGINT)
  - shipment_id (BIGINT)
  - original_queue_id (INT)
  - device_info (JSON)
  - created_at (TIMESTAMP)
  - processed_status (ENUM)

## ‚úÖ Business Logic Implementation

### 7. Reply Classification
- [ ] Pattern matching implemented for:

  - [ ] Reschedule requests (`RESCHEDULE`, `POSTPONE`, `DELAY`)
  - [ ] Complaints (`PROBLEM`, `ISSUE`, `WRONG`, `ERROR`)
  - [ ] General inquiries (questions)
- [ ] Default classification as `unknown` for unmatched patterns

### 8. Automated Actions
- [ ] PIN verification logic:
  - [ ] Extracts PIN from message
  - [ ] Compares with stored PIN for shipment
  - [ ] Updates shipment status on match
  - [ ] Logs failed attempts
  - [ ] Flags for review after 3 failures
- [ ] Opt-out processing:
  - [ ] Adds phone to opt-out list
  - [ ] Updates customer preferences
  - [ ] Sends confirmation if required
- [ ] Reschedule request handling:
  - [ ] Creates ticket/notification for manual review
- [ ] Unknown/inquiry handling:
  - [ ] Logs for manual review
